`jupyter_nebulagraph`, formerly `ipython-ngql`, is a Python package that simplifies the process of connecting to NebulaGraph from Jupyter Notebooks or iPython environments. It enhances the user experience by streamlining the creation, debugging, and sharing of Jupyter Notebooks. With `jupyter_nebulagraph`, users can effortlessly connect to NebulaGraph, load data, execute queries, visualize results, and fine-tune query outputs, thereby boosting collaborative efforts and productivity.

## Getting Started

```bash
pip install jupyter_nebulagraph
```

Load the extension in Jupyter Notebook or iPython:

```python
%load_ext ngql
%ngql --address 127.0.0.1 --port 9669 --user root --password nebula
```

Make queries:

```python
%ngql USE basketballplayer;
%ngql MATCH p=(v:player)-->(v2:player) WHERE id(v) == "player100" RETURN p;
```

Draw the graph:

```python
%ng_draw
```

Discover the features of `jupyter_nebulagraph` by experimenting with it on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/wey-gu/jupyter_nebulagraph/blob/main/docs/get_started.ipynb). You can also access a similar Jupyter Notebook in the documentation [here](https://jupyter-nebulagraph.readthedocs.io/en/stable/get_started_docs/).

### Installation

`jupyter_nebulagraph` could be installed either via pip or from this git repo itself.

> Install via pip

```bash
pip install jupyter_nebulagraph
```

> Install inside the repo

```bash
git clone git@github.com:wey-gu/jupyter_nebulagraph.git
cd jupyter_nebulagraph
python setup.py install
```

### Load it in Jupyter Notebook or iPython

```python
%load_ext ngql
```

### Connect to NebulaGraph

Arguments as below are needed to connect a NebulaGraph DB instance:

| Argument               | Description                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `--address` or `-addr` | IP address of the NebulaGraph Instance   |
| `--port` or `-P`       | Port number of the NebulaGraph Instance  |
| `--user` or `-u`       | User name                                |
| `--password` or `-p`   | Password                                 |

Below is an exmple on connecting to `127.0.0.1:9669` with username: "user" and password: "password".

```python
%ngql --address 127.0.0.1 --port 9669 --user user --password password
```

### Make Queries

Now two kind of iPtython Magics are supported:

Option 1: The one line stype with `%ngql`:

```python
%ngql USE basketballplayer;
%ngql MATCH (v:player{name:"Tim Duncan"})-->(v2:player) RETURN v2.player.name AS Name;
```

Option 2: The multiple lines stype with `%%ngql `

```python
%%ngql
SHOW TAGS;
SHOW HOSTS;
```

### Query String with Variables

`jupyter_nebulagraph` supports taking variables from the local namespace, with the help of [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/) template framework, it's supported to have queries like the below example.

The actual query string should be `GO FROM "Sue" OVER owns_pokemon ...`, and `"{{ trainer }}"` was renderred as `"Sue"` by consuming the local variable `trainer`:

```python
In [8]: vid = "player100"

In [9]: %%ngql
   ...: MATCH (v)<-[e:follow]- (v2)-[e2:serve]->(v3)
   ...:   WHERE id(v) == "{{ vid }}"
   ...: RETURN v2.player.name AS FriendOf, v3.team.name AS Team LIMIT 3;
Out[9]:   RETURN v2.player.name AS FriendOf, v3.team.name AS Team LIMIT 3;
FriendOf	Team
0	LaMarcus Aldridge	Trail Blazers
1	LaMarcus Aldridge	Spurs
2	Marco Belinelli	Warriors
```

### Draw query results

**Draw Last Query**

Just call `%ng_draw` after queries with graph data.

```python
# one query
%ngql GET SUBGRAPH 2 STEPS FROM "player101" YIELD VERTICES AS nodes, EDGES AS relationships;
%ng_draw

# another query
%ngql match p=(:player)-[]->() return p LIMIT 5
%ng_draw
```

![](https://github.com/wey-gu/jupyter_nebulagraph/assets/1651790/b3d9ca07-2eb1-45ae-949b-543f58a57760)

**Draw a Query**

Or `%ng_draw <one_line_query>`, `%%ng_draw <multiline_query>` instead of drawing the result of the last query.

<img width="1142" alt="ng_draw_demo_1" src="https://github.com/wey-gu/jupyter_nebulagraph/assets/1651790/a6e3b2d4-0320-4287-bd2f-537cff77c1de">

One line query:

```python
%ng_draw GET SUBGRAPH 2 STEPS FROM "player101" YIELD VERTICES AS nodes, EDGES AS relationships;
```

Multiple lines query:

```python
%%ng_draw
MATCH path_0=(n)--() WHERE id(n) == "p_0"
OPTIONAL MATCH path_1=(n)--()--()
RETURN path_0, path_1
```
### Draw Graph Schema

```python
%ng_draw_schema
```

![](https://github.com/wey-gu/jupyter_nebulagraph/assets/1651790/81fd71b5-61e7-4c65-93be-c2f4e507611b)

### Load Data from CSV

It's supported to load data from a CSV file into NebulaGraph with the help of `ng_load_csv` magic.

For example, to load data from a CSV file `actor.csv` into a space `basketballplayer` with tag `player` and vid in column `0`, and props in column `1` and `2`:

```csv
"player999","Tom Hanks",30
"player1000","Tom Cruise",40
"player1001","Jimmy X",33
```

Just run the below line:

```python
%ng_load --source actor.csv --tag player --vid 0 --props 1:name,2:age --space basketballplayer
```

Some other examples:

```python
# load CSV from a URL
%ng_load --source https://github.com/wey-gu/jupyter_nebulagraph/raw/main/examples/actor.csv --tag player --vid 0 --props 1:name,2:age --space demo_basketballplayer
# with rank column
%ng_load --source follow_with_rank.csv --edge follow --src 0 --dst 1 --props 2:degree --rank 3 --space basketballplayer
# without rank column
%ng_load --source follow.csv --edge follow --src 0 --dst 1 --props 2:degree --space basketballplayer
```

### Tweak Query Result

By default, the query result is a Pandas Dataframe, and we could access that by read from variable `_`.

```python
In [1]: %ngql MATCH (v:player{name:"Tim Duncan"})-->(v2:player) RETURN v2.player.name AS Name;

In [2]: df = _
```

It's also configurable to have the result in raw ResultSet, to enable handy NebulaGraph Python App Development.

### CheatSheet

If you find yourself forgetting commands or not wanting to rely solely on the cheat sheet, remember this one thing: seek help through the help command!

```python
%ngql help
```
